# Title: Using conda and IPython notebooks to demo external data access libraries
**Presenter:** Emilio Mayorga, UW Applied Physics Laboratory   
**Date:** November 3, 2015

I'll present demos of the ulmo and pyoos packages for accessing geoscience datasets from external sources, particularly for hydrology, oceanography and climate data. I might touch on THREDDS/OPeNDAP as well if there's time. While hopefully those will provide helpful resources for access to great datasets using more consistent tools, the topic is also an excuse to talk about reproducible, shareable Python via Conda environments, IPython/Jupyter notebooks, and the tool ecosystems sprouting around them.
