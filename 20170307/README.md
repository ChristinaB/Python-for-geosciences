This week we will have a hands-on, interactive session. We will explore various ways to access climate and hydrology data from public websites, each of which has different ways of serving their products. We'll dig into the pros and cons of various existing Python packages, and focus our discussion around some specific problems we're currently working on.

Climate site datasets we'll look at include [Snotel](https://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snow/). We'll examine Python packages including [climata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/climata), [ulmo](http://ulmo.readthedocs.io) and [obsio](https://github.com/jaredwo/obsio).
