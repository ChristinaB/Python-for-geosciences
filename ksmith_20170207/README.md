## 2017-02-04. Simplified Data Handling, Analysis, and Visualization Using PyFerret

**[Karl Smith](https://github.com/karlmsmith), JISAO-UW & NOAA**

[PyFerret](https://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/PyFerret) is a Python module, as well as a stand-alone interactive program, that provides on-demand data retrieval, aggregation, analysis, and visualization tools oriented for the geophysical sciences. PyFerret replaces and enhances the [Ferret](http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/) program, a popular tool with oceanographers and meteorologists worldwide for more than 25 years. Although the Ferret 'language', which somewhat resembles matlab scripting, is supported, PyFerret also provides Python objects enabling Ferret's delayed-mode, on-demand data handling in an Python-friendly environment. Major users of Ferret/PyFerret include GFDL (NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory), where it is primarily used for (multi-)model forecast analyses, as well as PMEL (NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory), where it is primarily used for collected data examination and analysis.

In this presentation, the Python interface of PyFerret will be presented. Recent enhancements and refinements to the `pyferret` Python module, as well as desired future directions for this module, will be discussed.
