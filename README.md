Python in the Geosciences
====
**Ongoing (Fall 2015-present) Seminar - University of Washington**

### Time:

1st Tuesday of the month, 4:00PM with Happy Hour to follow.

### Location:

6th floor of the Physics Tower, Seminar Room C607 or C610

### Background:

In recent years, the Python programming language has emerged as a popular choice for geoscientists. Python is an easy to learn, easy to read, fast to write, open source, multi-platform platform language. Accompanying the Python language is a large community of free, open source projects that have facilitated rapid scientific development and data analysis. This informal seminar will focus on new and existing Python tools and applications within the geoscience community and aims to connect Python users across the UW campus.
