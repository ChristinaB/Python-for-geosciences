## 2018-09-04. Taking stock of our seminar series: what's working, what should be changed?

**[Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom), UW APL**

The seminar series has been around since Fall 2015. How well has it worked out? Should it continue going? If yes, should it be changed in meaninful way (beyond tweaking)? **Volunteers to take over coordination?** I can help out, but new people and fresh perspectives would be good.

*Or has the seminar series run its course?*

Areas that could be changed:

1. **Thematic/domain spread, scope**
    - Has it been too broad, too narrow? More/less biology (ecology, environmental genomics)?
    - Change name to expand scope? "Python in BioGeosciences". Last year we had a good number of seminars focused on biological topics.
2. **Balance and range of speakers, their backgrounds**
    - Graduate students vs postdocs, faculty, etc. Undergraduates?
    - Academic vs agency and industry
3. **Technical depth**
    - Balance between sharing individual experience and learning/struggles, vs targeting more advanced, in-depth topics
    - Bring in more basic seminars, focused on, say, effective use of Pandas?
4. **Include other languages?**
    - Deliberately bring in other languages, specially R?
5. **Address related computing topics**
    - Examples: conda, docker, cloud computing
6. **YOUR thoughts!?** This list is just a conversation starter.
