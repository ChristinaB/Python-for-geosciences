## 2018-09-04. Taking stock of our seminar series: what's working, what should be changed?

### "Abstract" and pre-seminar notes

The seminar series has been around since Fall 2015. How well has it worked out? Should it continue going? If yes, should it be changed in meaninful way (beyond tweaking)? **Volunteers to take over coordination?** I can help out, but new people and fresh perspectives would be good.

*Or has the seminar series run its course?*

Areas that could be changed:

1. **Thematic/domain spread, scope**
    - Has it been too broad, too narrow? More/less biology (ecology, environmental genomics)?
    - Change name to expand scope? "Python in BioGeosciences". Last year we had a good number of seminars focused on biological topics.
2. **Balance and range of speakers, their backgrounds**
    - Graduate students vs postdocs, faculty, etc. Undergraduates?
    - Academic vs agency and industry
3. **Technical depth**
    - Balance between sharing individual experience and learning/struggles, vs targeting more advanced, in-depth topics
    - Bring in more basic seminars, focused on, say, effective use of Pandas?
4. **Include other languages?**
    - Deliberately bring in other languages, specially R?
5. **Address related computing topics**
    - Examples: conda, docker, cloud computing
6. **YOUR thoughts!?** This list is just a conversation starter.


### Notes from discussions during the seminar

- Only one person attended, probably because classes haven't started yet. These notes reflect only her input.
- Liked Tony's presentation last year, his focus on **his science** and data sources; but her work happened to overlap with Tony's emphasis, so there was a pre-existing linkage. He had no slides! And very little about Python
- Also liked Scott's presentation, but in a different way. Felt that there was too much material, code, to absorb during the presentation. But it was presented with good description of need, motivations. Useful, but not as interactive as Tony's
- The variety in seminars has been good, though
- Great to have all levels of people involved, as participants and also as presenters
- Participation will vary. People will make decisions on attending a particular seminar based on perceived overlap between presentation and their own interests
