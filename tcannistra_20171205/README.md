### Abstract 

A wide variety of tools exist for the processing of geospatial data in Python. I intend with this brief talk to collaboratively develop two pipelines for geospatial data assimilation and visualization through one or two specific vignettes, chosen from a United States national public lands demography project and a study into worldwide ecological impacts on mining. These are side projects and largely undeveloped, but demonstrate some tools that I find quite useful in quickly extracting and visualizing useful insight from geospatial data in Python, and that hopefully will engage the group and invite sharing of different methods among us.
