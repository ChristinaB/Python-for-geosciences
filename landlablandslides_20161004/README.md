# Learning about landsliding by launching a Landlab Jupyter Notebook from a HydroShare server.

Complex hydrologic and earth systems once coded in Fortran, C++ and cryptic scripts are being reconfigured in Open Source Python component based systems. In this workshop, we will demonstrate to participants one example of how this new type of modeling system, Landlab (introduced in the ending seminar of last UW Python for Geosciences Seminar), can be linked to CUAHSI resources, such as the Water Data Center (https://www.cuahsi.org/wdc) for time series data and HydroShare (www.hydroshare.org) to run models online, access model inputs, and publish outputs for research collaboration and public dissemination.

In this seminar we re-introduce [Landlab](http://landlab.github.io/#/), a Python-based modeling environment, that facilitates building numerical landscape models of earth surface dynamics such as geomorphology, hydrology, ecohydrology, glaciology, and stratigraphy, and expanding open source collaborations.  We will also demonstrate a Landslide tutorial implemented online via Hydroshare.

- Go back to HydroShare and Sign In with you user name (email) and password.
- Click on ‘Discover’ tab at top.
- In Search window, type: “Thunder Creek Landlab Landslide Example”. Select this resource.
- To run this tutorial within HydroShare, click on the 'Open With…' blue button and select'JupyterHub-USU'. Click on “Sign in with Hydroshare” box.
- Scroll down and execute the first code box (shift-enter) to ‘Establish a Secure Connection’ (note: you might be asked to enter your hydroshare password once again).
- Also execute second code box “Query HydroShare Resource Content”. 
- Content of this resource is provided, including the notebook we want.  Click on the “landslide_driver.ipynb” notebook in blue text at the top.
- Now you are inside the landslide tutorial.  Congratulations!
