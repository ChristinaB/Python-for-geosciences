## 2018-03-06. Python and R on the Cloud via JupyterHub and RStudio server

**[Don Setiawan](https://github.com/lsetiawan/), [UW APL](http://apl.uw.edu/)**

This seminar will demonstrate the capabilities to run Python and R code on the cloud using tools that the respective communities are already comfortable with on their local computers: Jupyter notebooks and RStudio. We will show their use in a hands-one workshop recently held in Seattle, the [IOOS Marine Biological Data Training Workshop](https://ioos.github.io/BioData-Training-Workshop/), which included sample data processing and data access scripts in both Python and R. I will briefly describe the underlying infrastructure, including the Amazon AWS cloud, Docker, conda, JupyterHub, Kubernetes, etc.
