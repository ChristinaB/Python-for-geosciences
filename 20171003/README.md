## 2017-10-03. MetSim, and lessons learned in legacy rewrites

**[Andrew Bennett](https://github.com/arbennett), UW Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE)**

In this seminar I will present [MetSim](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/MetSim), a new tool for generating meteorological forcing data.  I will introduce MetSim's origins, architecture, and methods, followed by a demo outlining usage on both the command line as well as for scripting purposes.  Finally, I will share some of the lessons I learned while developing MetSim.

*The presentation is available at Andrew's Github pages, [here](https://arbennett.github.io/slides/python_for_geosciences_seminar.html).*
