## 2017-01-10. My tools for data processing and interactively viewing rasters, specially time series of high-resolution DEMs

I will cover a suite of recently released command-line tools and Python libraries for raster geospatial data processing (pygeotools) and interactively viewing (imview).  I will focus on applications involving time series of high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for glaciers in WA/OR, but will describe tools that can be used for more general geospatial data analysis.  If there is time and interest, I can also cover some automated tools (demcoreg) that can be used to improve raster geolocation and reduce relative error via automated sub-pixel co-registration.
