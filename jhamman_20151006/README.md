Data analysis tools for modern Python: pandas, xray, and beyond
=======

Speaker: Joe Hamman

Date: October 6, 2015

Summary:

In this talk, I introduce the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [xray](http://xray.readthedocs.org/en/stable/) packages and highlight their geoscience use cases.  Both pandas and xray are data analysis packages that extend the numpy data model to include labeled axes. Pandas excels at 1D data analysis (e.g. timeseries) while xray extends the pandas approach to include N-dimensional labeled data objects. I introduce the pandas and xray approach to label based selection, timeseries resampling, and groupby operations. I also introduce the plotting functionality in both packages. At the end of this talk, I discuss a few horizons I see as the future of scientific python as they pertain to the geoscience community.
